# Banking-Project
Project written in C++ to demonstrate language proficiency and interface design proficiency. The application reads text data containing information about clients, their accounts, and the type of transactions each client wants to perform. A UML diagram was created beforehand to organize the classes that need to be made and how each class will be used.
